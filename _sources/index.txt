QGIS Plugin GPS Position Lag Correction Documentation
=====================================================

The plugin allows user to correct a record delay of points GPS
coordinates in QGIS. This delay occurs especially during airborne
monitoring where even for one second measurement the plane /
helicopter flies distance of several tens of meters. User is allowed
to shift points by values, by constant distance or by constant time
(variable distance considering current velocity).  Ellipsoid WGS84
(EPSG:4326) is used as a reference ellipsoid.

This plugin was developed on the demand of National Radiation
Protection Institute (`www.suro.cz <http://www.suro.cz>`__) for
processing airborne radiation monitoring data.

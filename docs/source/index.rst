QGIS Plugin GPS Position Lag Correction Documentation
=====================================================

The plugin allows user to correct a record delay of points defined by
GPS coordinates in QGIS. Such delay can occur especially during
airborne monitoring when even for one second measurement the plane /
helicopter flies distance of several tens of meters. User is allowed
to shift points by values, constant distance or by constant time
(variable distance considering current velocity). For calculating
distances user is allowed to choose a reference ellipsoid.

This plugin was developed on the demand of National Radiation
Protection Institute (`www.suro.cz <http://www.suro.cz>`__) for
processing airborne radiation monitoring data.
